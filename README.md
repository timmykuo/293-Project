# 293-Project

UXB Project completed for EECS293 taught by Professor Vincenzo Liberator at Case Western Reserve University.

To create a UXB System:

1) Create various hubs, printers, and webcams through their builders that are described in the constructor
of AbstractDevice. Notice the validation requirements for building each device. 

2) Connect them through setPeer(Connector connector). Notice ConnectionExceptions that are described in the 
Connector class.

3) Send any message to the devices! 

You can view one scenario of a UXB system and how you can build, connect, and send messages in DeviceTest.java.
